# Astrophysical Parameter Inference with Gravitational Wave and Electromagnetic Data Channels

## Lenfest Scholars Community Weekend 2019 Research Presentation

Neutron star mergers are a source of powerful gravitational wave signals.
Unlike black hole mergers, nearly all of them are expected to produce electromagnetic counterparts to these gravitational wave emissions.
By performing a joint analysis of both of these data channels, we can constrain an event's source parameters.
