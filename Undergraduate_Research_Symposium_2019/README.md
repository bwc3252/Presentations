# Parameter Inference with Gravitational Wave and Electromagnetic Data

## 2019 RIT Undergraduate Research Symposium

Binary neutron star mergers are a source of powerful gravitational wave signals. 
Unlike black hole mergers, they also produce supernova-like explosions called kilonovae, resulting in electromagnetic counterparts to their gravitational wave emissions. 
By performing a joint analysis of both data channels, we can constrain an event's source parameters more effectively than we could with either one individually. 
This is accomplished by modifying an existing gravitational wave parameter estimation code to support electromagnetic data and models.
